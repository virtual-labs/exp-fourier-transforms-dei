### About the Experiment  

This experiment focuses on Fourier Transform techniques, particularly the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which are essential tools in signal processing, image analysis, and scientific computing. Students learn how the DFT converts discrete signals from the time domain into the frequency domain, providing insights into frequency components of data. The FFT, an efficient algorithm for computing the DFT, significantly reduces computational complexity, making it suitable for large-scale applications. The experiment highlights both theoretical and practical aspects, including implementation, computational efficiency, and applications in data compression, filtering, and solving differential equations.
