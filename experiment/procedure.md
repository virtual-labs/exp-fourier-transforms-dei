Step1: Open the Fourier Transform simulation page.

Step2: Select the type of input signal provided in the interface.

Step3: Enter the amplitude of the signal.

Step4: Enter the frequency of the input signal.

Step5: Set the sampling frequency as required.

Step6: Specify the number of samples (if the option is available).

Step7: Click on the Generate Signal button to display the time-domain waveform.

Step8: Click on the Compute DFT/FFT button to obtain the frequency-domain output.

Step9: Observe the magnitude and phase spectrum generated on the screen.

Step10: Modify parameters (amplitude, frequency, sampling rate) and repeat the simulation to study their effects.
