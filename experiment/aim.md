### Aim

The aim of this experiment is to compute the Fourier transform of given signals using numerical techniques, and to analyze their frequency-domain characteristics.

Specifically, the objectives are:

1. To apply the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** for converting a discrete time-domain signal into its corresponding frequency-domain representation.
2. To implement the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** for efficient computation of the DFT.
3. To study the magnitude and phase spectrum of signals using Fourier transformations.
4. To understand and compare the computational performance of DFT and FFT methods.
5. To demonstrate the importance of Fourier analysis in fields such as signal processing, communications, and image analysis.
